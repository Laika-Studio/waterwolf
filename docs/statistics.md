## Usage statistics collection in WaterWolf

By default, WaterWolf sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed WaterWolf
* The version of WaterWolf that you're using
* How often you use certain features in WaterWolf
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of WaterWolf

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

WaterWolf does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in WaterWolf

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within WaterWolf and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
