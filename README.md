### Building binaries

In order to build WaterWolf from source, follow the installation instructions above, then use one of the following commands to create binaries:

- `npm run buildWindows`
<!-- - `npm run buildMacIntel`
- `npm run buildMacArm`
- `npm run buildDebian`
- `npm run buildRaspi` (for 32-bit Raspberry Pi)
- `npm run buildLinuxArm64` (for 64-bit Raspberry Pi or other ARM Linux)
- `npm run buildRedhat`-->

<!-- Depending on the platform you are building for, you may need to install additional dependencies:

- If you are building a macOS package, you'll need to install Xcode and the associated command-line tools. You may also need to set your default SDK to macOS 11.0 or higher, which you can do by running `export SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk`. The exact command will depend on where Xcode is installed and which SDK version you're using.
- To build on Windows, you'll need to install Visual Studio. Once it's installed, you may also need to run `npm config set msvs_version 2019` (or the appropriate version). -->
